Operation Research Lab
======================

***Course Code:*** MA30014  

To know more about the course, check out this [page](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/MA30014_:_Operation_Research).

**Update:** I am finally done with this lab, and have managed to secure an EX grade as well. :smile:

I hope this repository serves as an endpoint for any resources related to this subject, for future students taking up the course.
